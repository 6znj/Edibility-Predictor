# Edibility Predictor
## Determine if a mushroom is safe to eat or potentially deadly

Utilizes a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) to train a machine learning model that can predict edibility of mushrooms based on various characteristics.

The primary machine learning model used is the Random Forest Classifier.

## Feature Description
Attributes fed into the machine learning model include cap shape, cap color, odor, and other physical characteristics.

Based on these features, the model predicts whether a given mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Getting Started
To use this project, you'll need to install the required Python libraries ( listed in the `requirements.txt` file ).
